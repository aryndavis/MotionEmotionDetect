Final Project: Emotional Body Language in Golf 

COMS 4735 

Aryn Davis

### Background
I have been playing golf for the last 11 years of my life, and one thing that every instructor tells young golfers to do is manage their emotions and reactions while on the course. Even though you can sometimes see professional players explode on the course, they are usually very composed and show little emotion regarding a single shot. One of my favorite golfers since forever has been Tiger Woods, and he is known for being fairly composed while on the course. I will be creating a system to classify his resulting shot as either ‘good’ (fairway or green), ‘bad’ (1st or 2nd cut of rough, sand bunkers), or ‘horrible’ (in the trees, in the water, hazards, etc.), based on his body language, I believe that this is a valid visual interface. I don’t believe that this will be building upon prior work, but it will be similar in classification to the first assignment where we look at certain aspects of the pictures to decide what the picture represents.
